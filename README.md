# Sort-Algorithms-Comparison-Tool-Kit

# Created a sort performance analysis toolkit.

This will be a program which will analyse and compare the four different sort algorithms. 
The way it will be compared is by the time it takes for the array to be sorted.
The time will be in microseconds as this is a sensible value to be measured by the program. 
The array will be generated with random values. 
The time it takes for each algorithm to sort that array will be stored in a .CSV file. 

The generated .CSV file will be opened through Microsoft Excel, through which a line graph will be created. 
On the graph we will have time taken in microseconds and the size of array in integers. 
This will help clearly identify which algorithm takes longer to sort and which algorithm takes the fastest. 
Thus, gives an analysis for the algorithm.
